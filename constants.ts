  {
    question: "Is Homeopathy slow to act?",
    answer: "This is a common myth. In acute conditions like fevers or colds, homeopathy can act as fast as conventional medicine. In chronic cases (like arthritis or eczema) that have existed for years, cure takes time because we treat the root cause, not just suppress symptoms."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I take homeopathic medicines with other drugs?",
    answer: "Yes, generally. Homeopathic medicines are non-toxic and do not chemically interact with conventional drugs. However, always inform Dr. Hetal about your current prescriptions so she can manage the dosage effectively."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any dietary restrictions?",
    answer: "Minimal restrictions may apply, such as avoiding strong flavors like raw onion, garlic, or coffee immediately before or after taking the dose, as they might interfere with the absorption of the sweet pills."
  },
  {
    question: "Do steroids exist in homeopathy?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. Homeopathic remedies are prepared from natural sources (plants, minerals) and undergo potentization. Dr. Hetal Pandav follows ethical practice standards and ensures 100% steroid-free treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe for infants and pregnant women?",
    answer: "Yes, it is one of the safest systems of medicine for all ages, including newborns and pregnant women, as the doses are minute and devoid of toxic side effects."
